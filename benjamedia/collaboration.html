<blockquote>
<p>The crucial point, therefore is that a writer&#39;s production must have the 
character of a model: it must be able to instruct other writers in their 
production and secondly, it must be able to place an <strong>improved apparatus</strong>
at their disposal. This apparatus will be better the more consumers it 
brings in contact with the production process - in short, the more readers
or spectators it turns into <strong>collaborators</strong>.&quot;</p>
