<blockquote>
<p>Instead of asking: what is the position of a work vis-Ã -vis the social 
production relations of its time, does it underwrite these relations, is
it reactionary, or does it aspire to overthrow them, is it revolutionary?
... I should like to ask: what is its position <em>within</em> them? This question
concerns the function of a work within the literary production relations of
its time. In other words, it is directly concerned with literary <em>technique</em></p>
