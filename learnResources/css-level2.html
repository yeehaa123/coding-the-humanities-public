<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. With CSS you keep the layout information separate from the document content. It also makes it easy to use the same layout information for multiple web pages, so that they all have the same look and feel.</p>
