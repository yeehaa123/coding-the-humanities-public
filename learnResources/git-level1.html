<p>Git is the basis for collaborative projects. When you are working on files with others, you need a system to exchange these files and to keep track of what changes have been made to each file. Git takes care of this and stores a complete history of all changes so that you can go back to prevision versions. Each project can be stored in their own repository so you can easily manage them.</p>
