<p>GitHub is an essential platform to learn coding skills, where you&#39;re supported by other users. Github offers the means needed for a group to work both collectively and simultaneously on a single file, without ‘contaminating’ the original. Different changes (or parts thereof) might be moulded together and applied to the original at a latter stage, allowing the community to gain common ground on further development of it. Within more individual projects, the Github community can be called upon when users bump up against a problem, for which they themselves have no solution. Learning to understand and control the possibilities offered by Github might also help novice programmers to develop their ‘coding skills’ more quickly.</p>
