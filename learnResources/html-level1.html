<p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the main markup language for creating web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser. It is one of the fundamental building blocks of the web. It adds explicit structure to identify elements in a document such as titles, sections, tables etc, which tells the browser how to display each element. It also helps both humans and computers to interpret the content.</p>
