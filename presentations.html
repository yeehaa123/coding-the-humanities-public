It is a collaborative on- and offline platform for research and education. This platform, however, does not allow students and scholars to work  together. It also allows for more productive partnerships between  universities and private and public partners. This presentation sketches the dillemas, choices, and possibilities that such partnerships within the scope of Coding the Humanities entail.</p></section></section><section id="the-scholar-as-toolmaker" class="card presentation"><header><a href="./benjamedia.html"><h1>The Scholar as Toolmaker</h1></a></header><section><p>Ira Allen and Rob Ryder are translating Walter Benjamin&#x27;s radio plays for  children into English. The medial form of these pieces, however, are as  important as their verbal content. For that reason, we are currently  exploring how to adapt these pieces to online, interactive pieces. Using  Walter Benjamin&#x27;s &#x27;The Author as Producer&#x27; and the New York Times&#x27; &#x27;Snow  Fall&#x27; as inspiration, this presentation outlines the practical and  theoretical problems specific to the humanities that we have encountered so far.</p></section></section><section id="augmenting-masterpieces" class="card presentation"><header><a href="./rijks-presentation.html"><h1>Augmenting Masterpieces</h1></a></header><section><p>Augmenting Masterpieces uses a human-centered approach to link digital  interfaces to the physical museum visit. Its aim is to map the connections  between the physcial and the digital collection of The Rijksmuseum Amsterdam,  and to theoretically and practically investigate interfaces and features for  visitors which could be used in the museum. This presentation explores the role of code and humanities within this project.</p></section></section><section id="reading-jonathan-sterne" class="card presentation"><header><a href="./soundSignatures.html"><h1>Reading Jonathan Sterne</h1></a></header><section><p>&quot;Eliminate redundancies! Reduce bandwidth use! Travel great distances  frequently and with little effort! Accumulate on the hard drives of the  middle class! Address a distracted listening subject!&quot; In his essay &#x27;MP3 as  a Cultural Artifact&#x27;, Jonathan Sterne describes all the imperatives that the  MP3 format implicitly imposes on its listeners. This presentation, takes  this inventory as a starting point to debunk the myth of the harmless,  descriptive image of data altogether.</p></section></section><section id="coding-the-humanities" class="card presentation"><header><a href="./thatCamp.html"><h1>Coding the Humanities</h1></a></header><section><p>Scholars in the humanities use a wide range of specialized tools, each of which  only covers a small part of their research. Coding, on the other hand, is a  toolmaking tool. It gives you the power to write precise instruments that can  cover your entire workflow. In this workshop, we teach humanists how to build  custom tools or adjust existing ones to their specific needs.</p></section></section></section>
