<blockquote>
<p>An mp3 takes an existing CD-quality digital audio file and removes as much
data content as possible, relying on listener&#39;s bodies and brains to make
up the difference. For example, a three-minute stereo CD file takes up about
30 megabytes of disk space; a three-minute mp3 of average quality takes up 3
to 4 megabytes of disk space. This is accomplished through a variety of 
<strong>filters</strong> and processes.</p>
