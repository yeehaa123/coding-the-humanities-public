<p>&quot;On the one hand, the early modern university had relied so heavily on 
printed books in all their multilingual interrelations that the rather 
simultaneous emergence of technical, equally infallible construction drawings 
escaped its notice. Letters, ciphers, and diagrams in their threefold 
combination proved too alien for humanists. The combination, however, of type
and woodcut or copperplate enabled scientific visualization at a level of 
precision unheard of by Greeks and monks.&quot;</p>
