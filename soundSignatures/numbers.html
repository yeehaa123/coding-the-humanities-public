<p>With numbers everything goes. Modulation, transformation, synchronization; 
delay, storage, transposition; scrambling, scanning, mapping - a total media 
link on a digital base will erase the very concept of medium. Instead of 
wiring people and technologies, absolute knowledge will run as an endless loop. </p>
