The kind of humanities teaching that we propose will give Humanities students a unique profile that meets current needs of the job market  for academics with a skillset that combines a classical humanities education with programming skills. The programming experience will thus not only provide students with tools that help to innovate Humanities research but also make them more employable. 

Coding the Humanities will morover provide a test-bed for new forms of online learning developed specifically for the needs of humanities teaching and learning. Together with different private partners CtH will advance the conception and development of an online learning platform aimed specifically at humanities students, that combines practical assignments, theorectical discussions and critical reflection and encourages students develop their coding and research skills collaboratively.
