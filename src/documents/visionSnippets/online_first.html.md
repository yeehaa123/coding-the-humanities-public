Online academic education is currently mainly offered in the form of
Massive Open Online Courses. There is a reasonable fear, however, that
the lack of individual feedback and direct interaction in those MOOC
will lead to a decay of quality of education and scholarship.

We believe, that a more creative use of online teaching and a online
learning environments can actually help us educate both larger numbers
of students as well as give more attention to the individual student.
We call this approach **online first** and envision a platform that
combines the following elements:

+ Online learning exercises with behaviour-driven feedback

+ Collaborative assignments 

+ Peer-feedback in small groups, via an online platform and offline
meetings

+ A distributed repository and version control system (GitHub) that
encourages collaboration, sharing and reuse

+ A possibility to contribute bits of code collaboratively and copy and
comment on each others work in real-time

+ Large Q&A sessions where students get direct feedback from teachers 

+ Detailed metrics of the course to monitor progress of individual
students and groups of students

The application is set up such that universities can integrate learning
modules from CtH in their curriculums, while students can build up
their portfolios through research projects, with which they can show
both their progress to teachers and their skills and achievements to
employers. Furthermore, the application integrates naturally with Github
and other open source environments, lowering the threshold for a diverse
audience to reuse, copy and extend the prototypes, products and results
of interest to society, including the general public, other academics
and companies.
