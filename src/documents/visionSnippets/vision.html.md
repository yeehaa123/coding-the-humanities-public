title: 'Coding Skills'

Students and scholars in the humanities generally rely on prefabricated
tools to guide and instruct their learning and research. They are
reluctant to engage with technology through coding. This remains a
major distinction between the humanities and the sciences. The sciences
design, create and maintain their own digital research environments
and tools, while the humanities make do with prefabricated, and often
inappropriate, tools.

At the moment, there are no broadly available academic programming
courses aimed at humanities students and scholars. However, jobs related
to the humanities now strongly rely on digital tools, in terms of
communication, collaboration, documentation, visualization or analysis.
Thus coding skills become increasingly important and will continue to do
so in future for several reasons:


1. Knowledge of programming helps students and researchers to understand
the various technologically mediated objects that they are studying.

2. Developing custom tools, rather than using ready-made ones, can
improve the actual practice of humanities research as well as (the
quantity and quality of) its output.

3. There is an ever-growing demand in the public and private sector for
academics who can read and write code. 

4. Code can work as a basis for ambitious international research
collaborations in which partners of different size and with different
expertise can cooperate.
