<p>Online academic education is currently mainly offered in the form of Massive Open Online Courses. There is a reasonable fear, however, that the lack of individual feedback and direct interaction in those MOOC will lead to a decay of quality of education and scholarship.</p>
<p>We believe, that a more creative use of online teaching and a online learning environments can actually help us educate both larger numbers of students as well as give more attention to the individual student. We call this approach online first and envision a platform that combines the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Online learning exercises with behaviour-driven feedback</p>
</li>
<li><p>Collaborative assignments </p>
</li>
<li><p>Peer-feedback in small groups, via an online platform and offline meetings </p>
</li>
<li><p>A distributed repository and version control system (GitHub) that encourages collaboration, sharing and reuse</p>
</li>
<li><p>A possibility to contribute bits of code collaboratively and copy and comment on each others work in real-time</p>
</li>
<li><p>Large Q&amp;A sessions where students get direct feedback from teachers </p>
</li>
<li><p>Detailed metrics of the course to monitor progress of individual students and groups of students </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The application is set up such that universities can integrate learning modules from CtH in their curriculums, while students can build up their portfolios through research projects, with which they can show both their progress to teachers and their skills and achievements to employers. Furthermore, the application integrates naturally with Github and other open source environments, lowering the threshold for a diverse audience to reuse, copy and extend the prototypes, products and results of interest to society, including the general public, other academics and companies.</p>
