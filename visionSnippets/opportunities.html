<p>Programming offers opportunities for new kinds of collaborative work. Large scale research projects no longer need to be split into several topics or objects, but people can divide labor through different tasks and skill sets, using tools developed by humanities scholars for humanities scholarship. It allows for sustainable and enduring ventures as project results produced and published on open licenses can be taken over and further by developers from academic institutions or organisations different from the initiating ones.  </p>
<p>The following examples provide an overview on the research techniques Coding the Humanities seeks to experiment with and the kind of collaborative projects CtH aspires to stimulate.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>imaging, translation, mapping</p>
<p>example: <a href="http://boschproject.org/">Bosch project</a> </p>
</li>
<li><p>visualization, filtering, searching</p>
<p>example: <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo">New York Times Guantanamo project</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>publishing, linking</p>
<p>example: <a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/about">Public Knowledge Project</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>crowdsourcing, annotation, translation</p>
<p>example: <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/project/ancientlives">Zooniverse - Lives of the ancient Greeks</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This kind of large scale collaborative projects not only advance the internationalization of humanities research but make the humanities more attractive for external funding and more accessible for companies willing to cooperate.</p>
