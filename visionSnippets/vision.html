<p>Students and scholars in the humanities generally rely on prefabricated tools to guide and instruct their learning and research. They are reluctant to engage with technology through coding. This remains a major distinction between the humanities and the sciences. The sciences design, create and maintain their own digital research environments and tools, while the humanities make do with prefabricated, and often inappropriate, tools. </p>
<p>At the moment, there are no broadly available academic programming courses aimed at humanities students and scholars. However, jobs related to the humanities now strongly rely on digital tools, in terms of communication, collaboration, documentation, visualization or analysis. Thus coding skills become increasingly important and will continue to do so in future for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Knowledge of programming helps students and researchers to understand the various technologically mediated objects that they are studying. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Developing custom tools, rather than using ready-made ones, can improve the actual practice of humanities research as well as (the quantity and quality of) its output.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is an ever-growing demand in the public and private sector for academics who can read and write code. //This holds true especially with regard to data sets increasingly made accessible by public institutions like museums, archives or libraries.//</p>
</li>
<li><p>Code can work as a basis for ambitious international research collaborations in which partners of different size and with different expertise can cooperate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
